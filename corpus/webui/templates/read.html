                Joseon[a] (Korean: 조선; Hanja: 朝鮮; MR: Chosŏn; [tɕo.sʌn]),
                officially Great Joseon State (대조선국; 大朝鮮國;
                [tɛ.tɕo.sʌn.ɡuk̚]),[14] was the last dynastic kingdom of Korea,
                lasting just over 500 years.[15][16] It was founded by Yi
                Seong-gye in July 1392 and replaced by the Korean Empire in
                October 1897.[17] The kingdom was founded following the
                aftermath of the overthrow of Goryeo in what is today the city
                of Kaesong. Early on, Korea was retitled and the capital was
                relocated to modern-day Seoul. The kingdom's northernmost
                borders were expanded to the natural boundaries at the rivers of
                Amrok and Tuman through the subjugation of the Jurchens.

                During its 500-year duration, Joseon encouraged the entrenchment
                of Confucian ideals and doctrines in Korean society.
                Neo-Confucianism was installed as the new state's ideology.
                Buddhism was accordingly discouraged, and occasionally Buddhists
                faced persecutions. Joseon consolidated its effective rule over
                the Korean peninsula and saw the height of classical Korean
                culture, trade, literature, and science and technology. In the
                1590s, the kingdom was severely weakened due to the two failed
                Japanese invasions of 1592 and 1598. Several decades later,
                Joseon was invaded by the Later Jin dynasty and the Qing dynasty
                in 1627 and 1636–1637 respectively, leading to an increasingly
                harsh isolationist policy, for which the country became known as
                the "hermit kingdom" in Western literature. After the end of
                these invasions from Manchuria, Joseon experienced a nearly
                200-year period of peace and prosperity, along with cultural and
                technological development. What power the kingdom recovered
                during its isolation waned as the 18th century came to a close.
                Faced with internal strife, power struggles, international
                pressure, and rebellions at home, the kingdom declined rapidly
                in the late 19th century.

                  The king had absolute authority, but his actual power varied
                  with political circumstances. He was bound by tradition,
                  precedents set by earlier kings, Gyeongguk daejeon, and
                  Confucian teachings. The king commanded absolute loyalty from
                  his officials and subjects, but the officials were also
                  expected to persuade the king to the right path if the latter
                  was thought to be mistaken. Natural disasters were thought to
                  be due to the king's failings, and therefore, Joseon kings
                  were very sensitive to their occurrences. When there was
                  severe drought or a series of disasters, the king often
                  formally sought criticism from officials and citizenry. On
                  those occasions, critics were immune from prosecution,
                  regardless of what they said or wrote (although there were a
                  few exceptions).

                  Direct communication between the king and the common people
                  was possible through the sangeon (상언; 上言) written petition
                  system and the gyeokjaeng (격쟁; 擊錚) oral petition system.
                  Through the gyeokjaeng oral petition system, commoners could
                  strike a gong or drum in front of the palace or during the
                  king's public processions in order to appeal their grievances
                  or petition to the king directly. This allowed even the
                  illiterate members of Joseon society to make a petition to the
                  king. More than 1,300 gyeokjaeng-related accounts are recorded
                  in the Ilseongnok.[52][53][54]
